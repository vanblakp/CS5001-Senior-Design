## Project Topic Area
For our senior design project, we developed a video game based on
a historical event, namely The Alamo, to not only let players have fun, but
also experience a bit of history and learn something too.
We decided to work with the Unity game engine to keep things relatively simpler
to work with and chose to do a 2D top-down style of game for the same reason.
The game is wave-based and the player must survive against the onslaught of
the Mexican army attacking the fort. The longer a player survives, the higher a score they achieve.
Multiple days and NPC's were planned to be added, however due to time they were not.
Future updates may or may not occur.
