## Project Topic Area
For our senior design project, we plan on developing a video game based on
a historical event, namely The Alamo, to not only let players have fun, but
also experience a bit of history and learn something too.
We decided to work with the Unity game engine to keep things relatively simpler
to work with and chose to do a 2D top-down style of game for the same reason.
