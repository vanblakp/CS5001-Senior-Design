# **Fall**
I am a member in a group for the senior design project which has chosen to focus on
video game development. While I have not formally studied this topic, I have no doubt that many
of the concepts which have been covered through UC’s computer science curriculum, as well as
my co-op rotations, will prove beneficial in being able to have a successful year of working on
the project. This project is an opportunity to not only show the skills that I have already learned,
but to practice my ability to continue to learn new skills and apply familiar concepts to new areas
of application. I do not view this class as simply another set of assignments with an “exam” at
the end, but rather a reward for persevering through the curriculum and now having the
opportunity to demonstrate my skills in a fun way. Having the freedom to decide on what the
project will cover and how it will be designed will also provide a unique experience in which I
am on a team with other stakeholders but have much more input as to how things should be done
and what exactly is it that will be done. Being both an overseer and developer of the project will
offer a new perspective as opposed to the ones found in a course of study or co-op work
environment.

The specific curriculum at UC has built a strong foundation from which to begin the
senior design project. First, CS 2028 Data Structures course introduced object-oriented
programming skills and taught us how to think about objects as classes which possess attributes
and perform actions with methods is useful. Knowing how objects relate and are able to interact
is beneficial for a game development setting as the interaction of different entities is the basis for
many games. Many of the actual data structures we learned about as well will be useful to have
knowledge of to think about how to store game related data in an efficient way and perform
complex operations on that data. The next class from the curriculum that will be beneficial
towards this project is CS 3093 Software Engineering. This class provided an overview and indepth look at the project management process, and the practices of gathering requirements and generating user stories. Additionally, deciding on a framework for which to manage our project
will be very applicable and handy. It is so easy as a young student to go into a project and just
start writing code and hoping for the best, but this course presented crucial information for the
project setup and planning phase. The final course I would like to touch on is CS 4071 Design
and Analysis of Algorithms. Depending on what type of video game we elect to create, we will
need to have thorough knowledge of how to write algorithms and assess their performance. This
class provided the tools to do that, and when we consider how to optimize a game and ensure
minimum performance is attainable, we will no doubt put these tools to use. Other classes that
provided beneficial knowledge are CS 2071 Discrete Structures, CS 5170 Automata, CS 3003
Programming Languages, CS 2021 Python Programming, CS 4092 Database Design, CS 4065
Networking, CS 4033 AI Principles, and CS 4029 Operating Systems, to name a few. The
concepts, principles, and assignments geared towards applying this knowledge in each of these
classes have some application in game development and have prepared me and my group to
undertake this project.

The built-in co-op program has also provided countless learning opportunities which will
prove beneficial for the development of our senior project. For me specifically, I spent my early
co-op rotations working in the IT department at Cincinnati Insurance Company. I gained
exposure to seeing how network infrastructure and server performance was crucial to a large
corporate environment. I was able to contribute by creating data visualizations and dashboards to
be used by non-tech VPs and executives, which relates to game development in making an
accessible UI which anyone can use and understand. I was able to work on the backend side of
the company’s policy rating engine and see how different UIs interact with backend code. Large,
complex projects with millions of lines of code require a thorough understanding of how data is
able to be transformed and transferred across project boundaries and even networks, and these
concepts relate directly to game development. My later co-op rotations occurred at London
Computer Systems where I worked on the backend for a web API which serves both internal and
external stakeholders. I was again able to understand more about how data is communicated,
changed, and saved, as well as how a complex project with millions of lines combines all of the
different pieces it needs to create one working product. I think the foundations I learned in data
representation, and how data is stored in a database and accessed by server-side code will prove
to be beneficial in developing games. Additionally, at LCS, I worked in an agile environment
where we engaged in weekly sprint planning meetings and identified crucial tickets which
needed to be completed. I think this project structure will serve the senior design project well, as
we will have new work to do every week and will need to touch base with standup meetings to
ensure we’re all working towards the same goal and are able to provide and offer help where
necessary.

I am motivated to work on this project because, as I touched on in the introduction, it is
an opportunity to take on the new role as more of a “project designer” and be able to showcase
the many skills I have learned throughout my time at UC. I often find it hard to complete
individual projects and to stay accountable for working on my own, but when I have academic or
professional motivations it is certainly easier to get work done. This project will allow me to
learn new skills by applying familiar concepts, and the outcome will hopefully be a functional
project that I can be proud of and present on my resume. I think that video games are fun and
exciting, and having the opportunity to explore this area of software is something that I look
forward to. I expect that the result of this project will be a rewarding and satisfying experience
where I will feel more comfortable and competent as a software developer. I hope to pick up new
skills along the way too, such as familiarity with game engines, knowledge of 3D/2D graphic
design for game art, a better understanding object-oriented principles and class design, and
perhaps even practical knowledge about networking and connecting two clients via a game
server.

My group will first approach the project by coming up with an idea and then identifying
everything that will be necessary to achieving it. We will start by planning out our game,
identifying what the objective of the game, choosing an engine with which to develop it, and
start making lists of requirements and constraints. We will evaluate ourselves by ensuring we are
keeping pace with what the expectations are from within the class, and then addressing problems
as they arise with our faculty advisor. Being able to play test our game as we develop it will help
us ensure whether or not we are on the right track and having the immediate feedback of jumping
into a test environment and debugging our implementations will be an often and necessary
process for the development of the project. It will be evident based upon the functionality and
performance of the game if we are on the right track and doing a good job. I hope personally that
I will be able to contribute to the project in many ways, specifically the design and planning,
writing of code, and creation of 3D models or 2D art to be used as assets in the game.


# **Spring**
I found that in working on this capstone project I was able to apply and build on my skills learned through the computer science program at UC. I identified skills in the fall such as data structures, software engineering, database management, and algorithms. Each of these came into play for the project, primarily through the need to build scripts to control the game we created, as well as the large-scale, high-level skills of managing a software project, breaking up the work, and progressing from requirements to a working project. It was a beneficial experience to be a part of a team where we were all “equals”, and did not follow the typical hierarchy of having a manager, directors, or even business analysts controlling everything we did. It required myself, and the others, to have to step up to make decisions, and think about how these decisions would impact the project and the group. These are skills that are not typically learned while on co-op or in the classroom.

I learned many new things in building the capstone project. I became much more familiar with the Unity Engine and the Mono scripting library. I learned how game components interact with each other, how a game object’s properties are accessed and manipulated in code, and I learned an entirely new style of programming. A success that stands out to me was incorporating a character with animations from a sprite sheet and developing the transitions between the different animations in code. In addition to working on the character graphics and animations, I also built the game’s menu system, which was an interesting challenge. I have never done any UI design on my co-ops, so it was fun to learn about the skills needed for this aspect of a project.
