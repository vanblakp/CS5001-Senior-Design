# **Introduction**
For our Senior Design project, our team plans to create a video game using one of the popular game engines.
I plan to go in to game development as a career so I hope this project will help me expand upon my skills to pursue that.
Currently, we have yet to decide what specifically our game will be about.
We are still in the brainstorming process and have generated a few ideas, but nothing has fully stuck with us yet.
We plan to figure this out as soon as possible so we can get to work on it right away.

# **Experience**
A large portion of the computer science skills that I have acquired from UC can apply to game development.
Linear Algebra (MATH 2076) is the primary example since game engines heavily use 2D and 3D spaces. Which means that a lot of the programming 
involves vectors, transforms, and the many things that come with those topics. This greatly helped me be able to learn
Unreal Engine and Unity on my own since I was able to transfer the mathematical skills into the engines. On top of that, 
I was able to visually see the changes that I made which further helped my spatial intelligence.

In terms of my co-op experience, the only one that really applied to game development was my final semester at Siemens.
I was fortunate enough to be able to work on Unity with the Oculus Quest 2 VR Headset.
With this, I implemented a prototype involving hand tracking and 3D model interactions (such as grabbing, translating, rotating, scaling, etc.).
This was the initial start for the XR Training Project and will be used in the future to further that project at the company.
Because of this, I believe my skills in Unity have improved by a lot.
I also now have experience working with VR development which is very new and exciting.

# **Motivation/Approach**
I am very excited to work on this project since I plan to go into game development as a career.
This will not only improve my skills in both computer science and game development, but also working with a team on a game.
I have done a couple game jams in the past, however most of my game development experience has come from working on games by myself.
With four people, I expect us to be able to develop a solid game and with the timeframe of this project, we should be able to 
polish the game quite a lot.
In terms of when we will be done, I think that a game can always be improved upon, even in the slightest bit.
However, I believe we will have created a final product when everything is working properly and there is minimal to no bugs.
Throughout the term, I will be consistent with myself and my team and make sure that I have contributed enough or more than enough.
