I focused on developing the base game which included the code behind the player, enemies, walls, and map. Specifically, I programmed all of the mechanics involving movement, the shooting/combat system, sprinting/stamina, health, collisions, destruction and reparation of the walls, AI movement/pathing/targeting, deaths, sound effects, the majority of the map, the wave spawner system, the HUD and death UIs, the scoring mechanic, and some smaller details and bug fixes. I also made the final build of the game which required some cleanup work for it to properly build, and I made a quick video to use at the expo. I did quite a lot and certainly expanded upon my previously learned skills within Unity and game development.
