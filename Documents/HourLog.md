# Actual Hours Spent

## Henry Stiefel
#### Fall Semester Justification: \
Actual Hours: 45 \
In the fall, much time was spent on the initial planning phase of the project, researching ideas, and beginning to learn about the tools and technologies available to us. The class assignments were able to guide us through most of the necessary planning steps, and that is where a majority of the actual time spent went. Other tasks which occupied my working time were researching the Unity engine and learning basic game design concepts, as well as browsing for assets that could be used in the game. 

#### Spring Semester Justification: \
Actual Hours: 45 \
In addition to the regular classwork and the meetings our team held, I helped with the development of the game, asset creation and preparation, and editing and splicing audio to use for in-game music and sound effects. I worked on the game's animations, implementing the sprites for both the enemy and player characters, controlling the animations to change based on game triggers, added in music for both the menu and game's fight scene, and created UI elements such as the main menu, options menu, and pause menu. Much of the time spent throughout both semesters was invested in learning how to write code for Unity and create games with the engine, which allowed me to develop new skills and understand more about the process of game development. 

## Kyle Van Blaricom
Yearly Hours: 45 \
Justification: 
My focus for the project was on learning fundamental Unity mechanics that could help me design core gameplay aspects. This included creating sprites and interactive objects, setting up collision detection systems in the environment, integrating the interactive objects (items that could be picked up) with our currently existing health and stamina systems that we had set up, and designing animations for items. Because one of our group members had a much stronger foundation in Unity, combat and enemy AI gameplay mechanics that I developed in my individual folder did not make it into the final project, but they helped me to understand how to apply the mechanics I learned to other aspects of the final product. Despite having virtually no game development experience coming in to my final year of school, I felt that I learned a lot about the process of game design from the ground up. I also worked weekly with our team to meet deadlines and get assignments turned in.

## Eric Michalski
Yearly Hours: 90 \
Justification: 
I focused on developing the base game which included the code behind the player, enemies, walls, and map. Specifically, I programmed all of the mechanics involving movement, the shooting/combat system, sprinting/stamina, health, collisions, destruction and reparation of the walls, AI movement/pathing/targeting, deaths, sound effects, the majority of the map, the wave spawner system, the HUD and death UIs, the scoring mechanic, and some smaller details and bug fixes. I also made the final build of the game which required some cleanup work for it to properly build, and I made a quick video to use at the expo. I did quite a lot and certainly expanded upon my previously learned skills within Unity and game development.


## Ryan Moore
Yearly Hours: 45 \
Justification: Between participating in our regular team meetings and helping organize our documents and work, much of my focus was on learning about Unity and 2D games and helping test the game to make sure it worked properly. Some work I attempted to finish was done faster by other team members. Tutorials online were used to understand how 2D game development works and how to apply it to our project. I learned more about the importance of working with different team roles works and organizing the project between the whole team. I also learned more about Unity itself after having mostly little experience with it before the project began last semester.
