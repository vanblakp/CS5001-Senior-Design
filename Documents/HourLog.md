# Actual Hours Spent

## Henry Stiefel
Hours: 45 \
Justification: 
In addition to the regular classwork and the meetings our team held, I helped with the development of the game, asset creation and preparation, and editing and splicing audio to use for in-game music and sound effects. I worked on the game's animations, implementing the sprites for both the enemy and player characters, controlling the animations to change based on game triggers, added in music for both the menu and game's fight scene, and created UI elements such as the main menu, options menu, and pause menu. Much of the time spent throughout both semesters was invested in learning how to write code for Unity and create games with the engine, which allowed me to develop new skills and understand more about the process of game development.

## Eric Michalski
Hours: 90 \
Justification: 
I focused on developing the base game which included the code behind the player, enemies, walls, and map. Specifically, I programmed all of the mechanics involving movement, the shooting/combat system, sprinting/stamina, health, collisions, destruction and reparation of the walls, AI movement/pathing/targeting, deaths, sound effects, the majority of the map, the wave spawner system, the HUD and death UIs, the scoring mechanic, and some smaller details and bug fixes. I also made the final build of the game which required some cleanup work for it to properly build, and I made a quick video to use at the expo. I did quite a lot and certainly expanded upon my previously learned skills within Unity and game development.
