# **Task List**

## **UI Layer**
### **Henry**
- Research effective UI methods, study other game methods for creating functional and aesthetic UI
- Design a game menu that clearly demonstrates game options and how a player can adjust them (i.e. audio/visual settings, controls, etc.)
- Design a HUD (heads-up display) that is functional and aesthetic
- Design an in-game menu that displays text prompts and player choices based on the prompts
- Test interactions between the UI layer, Graphics layer, and Event layer

## **Graphics Layer**
### **Ryan**
- Design or modify visual assets to be used for creating the game world
- Render 3D objects used in the game's world and place them around to build areas and settings
- Render 2D sprites in conjunction with 3D objects for the game's world
- Manipulate and animate objects on-screen based on event code in gameplay
- Display the game's graphics and world below the UI layer for clear viewing for the user

## **Event Layer**
### **Eric**
- Implement triggers for in-game action inputs (i.e. WASD keys to move the player, keys for interacting, etc.)
- Design the code that runs based on the decisions that a player makes
- Develop the player character code (i.e. movement, speed, etc.)
- Implement a health and inventory system for the player
- Develop the code that adjusts game settings when a player changes them

## **Data Layer**
### **Kyle**
- Research database methods for storing settings selected by user for loading in during future sessions (i.e. audio/visual settings, controls, etc.).
- Design a database that will store all game info, including stored user settings and save game states.
- Develop a database for save game state that will store event data, health/ammo data, enemy data, decision-based data, and progress from previous sessions.
- Test database with different settings and save game states to ensure consistency of implementation when variables are altered.
- Validate that data can be both sent to and received from the database in a seamless fashion without errors.
